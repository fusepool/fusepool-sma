Fusepool-SMA
============

This project is an implementation of a dictionary-matching algorithm as an enhancer engine.

##What is Fusepool SMA

Fusepool SMA is a pure Java based Apache Stanbol enhancement engine, it is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm. It was created as an alternative solution for entity extraction, because it is much more flexible than any model-based NER solution. The Aho-Corasic string matching algorithm is a dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of words and expressions which is called the dictionary, within the input text. The input of the enhancer is plain, unstructured text, the output is RDF that contains the extracted entities and additional information on the enhancement.
